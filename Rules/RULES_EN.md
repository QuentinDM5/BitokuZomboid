# Bitoku Zomboid rules

**Administrators and moderators may transfer, kick or ban as they see fit. If you feel you've been mistreated, send a DM to an Admin and we'll sort it out**.

All channels have a description explaining their purpose. If you don't understand something, don't hesitate to ask!

**Your presence on this server implies acceptance of these rules, including any subsequent changes. These changes may be made at any time without notice, so it is your responsibility to check them**.

## 1. Be respectful

This means no nasty, rude or harassing comments. Treat others as you want to be treated.

## 2. No inappropriate language

The use of profanity should be kept to a reasonable minimum. Any derogatory language directed at a user is prohibited. Swearing is only allowed in casual channels, while official help and code channels must be free of profane language.

## 3. No spam

Don't send lots of small messages one after the other. This disrupts the chat and makes it difficult to navigate the server.

## 4. No porn/adult/NSFW material

The idea behind this server is to provide a safe place to share art, videos, and other types of creative material - not to share the NSFW material mentioned above.

## 5. No advertising

No invasive advertising, either for other communities or for streams. You can publish your content in the media channel if it's relevant and adds real value to the community.

## 6. No offensive names or profile pictures

Make sure your names and profile pictures are appropriate.

## 7. Raiding servers

Server raiding is contrary to Discord's terms of use. Any attempt to circumvent this may result in a permanent ban.

## 8. Threats are forbidden

Threats are forbidden and unauthorized.

## 9. Respect Discord's community guidelines
