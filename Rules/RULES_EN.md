# Bitoku Zomboid rules

**Admins and moderators can mute, kick or ban at will. If you feel mistreated, send a DM to an Admin and we'll solve the problem.**

All channels have a description explaining their purpose. If you don't understand something, feel free to ask !

**Your presence on this server implies acceptance of these rules, including any subsequent changes. These changes may be made at any time without notice, so it is your responsibility to check them.**

However, this is **our** server, so your opinion is always welcome.

## General rules

### 1. Be respectful

This means that we do not tolerate personal attacks, rude remarks or harassment. Don't attack others, treat them as you **want** to be treated.

### 2. No inappropriate language

The use of profanity must be kept to a reasonable minimum. 
Disparaging language is forbidden (see [General rule 1](#1-be-respectful "Go to general rule 1")).
Swearing is permitted only in occasional channels, while official channels for help, announcements and information must be free of inappropriate language.

### 3. No spam

Don't send a large number of small messages one after the other. This disrupts the chat and makes it difficult to navigate the server.

### 4. No porn/adult/other NSFW material

The idea behind this server is to provide a safe place to share art, videos, and other types of creative material - not to share the NSFW material mentioned in the title of this rule.

### 5. No advertising

No invasive advertising, either for other communities or for streams. You can publish your content in the "shares" channel if it's relevant and adds real value to the community.

### 6. No offensive names or profile photos

Make sure your names and profile photos are appropriate.

### 7. No threats

Threats, **even fake**, are categorically forbidden and will be severely reprimanded.

## Discord-specific rules

### 1. Raiding servers

Raiding servers is contrary to Discord's terms of use. Any attempt to circumvent this may result in a permanent ban.

### 2. Respect Discord's community guidelines

## Rules specific to Project Zomboid

### 1. Fire and PvP

Fire is allowed and PvP (*Player vs. Player*) can be enabled on the server. This is a deliberate choice, so as not to restrict us in our post-apocalyptic adventure. **Thank you for not abusing it**. We assume that we can trust each other and are responsible adults.

Don't forget that many people invest hours in a character, whether it's in his progression or in his RP, so please respect everyone's freedom.

### 2. Shelters and PvP confrontations
We've decided to protect shelters from looting and destruction when members are offline, to prevent abuse. However, when members are online, they are considered responsible for protecting their shelter.

Furthermore, during PvP events, we expect participants not to make wild disconnections simply to render themselves and their shelter invulnerable, for example when they are being raided. The admins reserve the right to deactivate a shelter's protection if this rule is not respected.

*Note: for each PvP event, we will ask players/factions beforehand whether or not they wish to participate. This is to avoid any confusion*.
